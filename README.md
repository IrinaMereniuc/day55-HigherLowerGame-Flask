# DESCRIPTION 
This is my coding bootcamp day 55 project.

This is an interpretation of the Higher-Lower game. The user needs to type the guess into the path.
The code has been created to dive deeper into web development with Flask (rendering HTML, parsing URLs and Flask Debugging).

## Usage

Set up the local development server that would host the website with the game:

To run the Flask app:
1. export/set the env variable
2. use the Flask command called run

In the Terminal / Command Prompt type:

on MacOS:
```bash
$ set FLASK_APP=server.py
```
on Windows:
```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=server.py
```
then 
```bash
$ flask run
```

Click on the link to launch the website in your browser. 

To quit, press CTRL+C (once you are done with your server).
